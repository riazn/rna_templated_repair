This alteration is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein, and truncating variants in CHEK2 are known to be pathogenic.  This variant has been identified in 0.009% of European (non-Finnish) chromosomes by gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/; dbSNP), and has been reported in individuals affected with breast, prostate, bladder, colon and urethral cancer (PMID: 21244692, 24113346, 24556621, 26534844, 26681312, 27273131, 28779002, 29520813, 29961768).  In summary, based on the previous reports of this variant in individuals with CHEK2 associated disease and its truncating effect on the protein, this variant is classified as pathogenic Studies indicate that pathogenic variants in CHEK2 confer an increased risk of developing many types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, and other cancers (PMID: 18004398).

This alteration is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein, and truncating variants in RAD51D are known to be pathogenic.  This variant has been found in one chromosome in gnomAD, and has been reported in the literature in individuals with breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 25452441, 26261251, 26681312).  In summary, based on the previous reports of this variant in individuals with RAD51D associated cancers and its truncating effect on the protein, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic.   Pathogenic RAD51D germline variants have been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (PMID: 21822267, 26261251).

This variant was reported in three families with early onset breast and/or ovarian cancers (PMID: 26057125, 24139550, and 27616075). This variant is predicted to affect the natural splice donor site by multiple algorithms. Functional analysis indicated this variant results in an out-of-frame exon 8 skipping and is expected to lead to an absent or truncated protein in two independent studies (PMID: 26057125, 24139550). RAD51C mutations have been reported in breast and ovarian cancer families (PMID: 22451500, 20400964) and confer increased risk of ovarian (PMID: 26261251).  Based on the currently available information, we consider RAD51C c.1026+5_1026+7delGTA to be a likely pathogenic variant.

This mutation confers an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in women and of breast cancer in men, and is a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (PubMed 9042909  ). Additionally, BRCA2 mutations may also confer an increased risk of other cancers including pancreatic cancer (PubMed 9140390  ) and prostate cancer (PubMed 11170890  ). Because the mutation is transmitted with a probability of 50% from a carrier parent to child, we also recommend testing for this disease-causing mutation in the relatives of the patient as appropriate. Note: BRCA2 c.5946delT is also known as BRCA2 6174delT.

This alteration is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein, and truncating variants in BRCA1 are known to be pathogenic.  This variant is absent from large population databases (1000 Genomes, ESP, Broad ExAC, gnomAD) and has been reported in individuals with breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 10528853, 17221156, 17591842, 18042939, 19818148, 21989927, 25682074, 26219728).  In summary, based on the previous reports of this variant in individuals with BRCA1 associated cancers and its truncating effect on the protein, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic.   Note: This variant may also be referred to as BRCA1 633delC in the literature. Women carrying a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation are at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.  Additionally, BRCA1 pathogenic variants have been associated with an increased risk of other cancers including prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 12237281).

This heterozygous MSH3 c.978_984delTTCCCGG variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, and leads to a premature termination codon 3 amino acids downstream (p.Phe326Leufs*3).  This variant has been identified in <0.01% of chromosomes by gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org), and has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature.  Based on the truncating nature of this variant, it is classified as likely pathogenic. Biallelic MSH3 germline mutations are associated with autosomal recessive colorectal adenomatous polyposis (PMID: 27476653).  If a monoallelic MSH3 mutation carriers partner is also a monoallelic carrier for a pathogenic MSH3 mutation, there is a 25% risk that each child would have two germline MSH3 pathogenic variants. Such individuals would have an increased risk for colorectal polyposis.

This variant has been identified in 1/113698 European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). It has been reported in the literature in many families with Lynch syndrome (PMID: 10422993, 12891553, 17569143, 21642682, 21681552.)  Functional studies have shown that this variant leads to reduced MLH1 expression and abrogated function (PMID: 12891553, 17510385).    The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours  (http://insight-group.org/) classifies this variant as pathogenic.  In summary, based on the previous reports of this variant in many individuals with MLH1 associated cancers, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic.   Note: This variant may also be referred to as MLH1 K616del in the literature.   Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition that confers an increased risk for colorectal cancer and endometrial cancers as well as other cancers.  There is a 50% chance that each child would inherit this variant from a parent.
